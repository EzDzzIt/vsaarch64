A swift defeat lurks at every corner for those who neither study their surroundings nor think their moves through with care.\nTrust you wits and slowly, surely, you will conquer the mysteries before you.\n\nYou do remember why you are here, right?\nOr have you lost something?\nSomething very important to you.\"",
